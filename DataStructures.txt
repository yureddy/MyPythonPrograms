SEQUANCES 
These represnet finite ordered set indexed by non-negative numbers.
the built-in function len() returns the number of items of a sequance 

SLICING
Sequances also support slicing. a[i:j] selects all items with index k such that
i<=k<j When used as an expression, a slice is a sequance of same type. 

EXTENDED slicing.
Some sequances also support extended slicing third paramer a[i:j:k] selects all
items of with index x where x =i + n*k, n >=0 and i<=x<j

Sequnces are distinguished according to their mutability.
