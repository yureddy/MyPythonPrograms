Class definionts likde funciton definitions must be executed before they have any efferct 
You can put a class definiont in a branch of an if statment or inside a funciton

In general, statements insdie a class definiont will usually be a function definiont.
But other statements are allwoed.

Function definionts inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by 
calling conventions of methods 

When a class definion is entered a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope.
Thus all the assignments to local variable go into this new namespace. In particular, funciotn 
definions bind the name of new function here.

When a class definion is left normally, a class object is created.
this is basically a wrapper around the contents of namespace cretad by the class definitions
i.e after the class definions ends the original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definions was entered)
is reinstated, the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definitoni header
