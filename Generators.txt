Geneartor are simple and powerfull tool for creating iterator.
They were written like regular functions but use the yield statement whenever thy want to return data

Each time next() is called on it , the generateor resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data
values and which statemnt was last executed). An example shos that generator can trivially easty to 
create.
